# Contenders Results

During the first week of Overwatch Contenders I was unhappy with the experience of navigating through the Contenders website to find team scores, so I created a web scraper to go through the website and strip it of the data I needed. I then saved it on the server and had the website request the data then write it on the page using pure Javascript.

Originally the site was all on one server, however I had to decomission it for other uses.

TODO: fix script to run when called. (It currently won't do that.)
